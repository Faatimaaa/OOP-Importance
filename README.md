Importance of OOP and why it is necessaryin C++

Imagine you're building a house out of different types of blocks. OOP is like having special building blocks that come with their own instructions and can do specific things.

Modularity: Each block represents a different part of your house, like walls, windows, and doors. With OOP, you can easily swap out or add new blocks without messing up the whole structure.
Reusability: Once you've built a cool block for, say, a window, you can use it in other houses without having to rebuild it every time.
Encapsulation: OOP keeps each block's secrets hidden. You don't need to know how the window block works internally; you just need to know how to use it.
Inheritance: Imagine creating a new type of block called "FancyWindow" that's just like a regular window but with extra decorations. Instead of starting from scratch, you can inherit all the traits and functions of the regular window block and just add the fancy stuff.
Polymorphism: This fancy word means you can treat different types of blocks the same way, even if they do things slightly differently. For example, whether it's a big window or a small window, you can still open and close it the same way.
In short, OOP makes coding like playing with building blocks â€“ easy, organized, and fun!
